        <p>Notta Boss is a small, independent software studio led by <Link href="https://eagostini.github.io">Eddie</Link> — backed by decades of experience building real, reliable systems for real businesses, from kiwi-fruit orchards and civil-construction logistics to hospitals and real-estate workflows. Small on purpose, efficient by design.</p>
        <p>It's also built to grow. Maybe it becomes a muscular robotic kiwi, maybe a trend, maybe something bigger — the plans are in motion, but not all of them can be revealed just yet. What matters is that the work stays sharp, honest, and built to last.</p>
        <p>You get direct expertise, no layers, no noise — just solid engineering and clear communication. Not a single basket. More like a golden kiwi egg, if you will.</p>
