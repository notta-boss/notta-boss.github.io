        <p>Artificial intelligence isn’t the problem.<br />Humans… we’re the problem. There, I said it.</p>
        <p>AI is everywhere, it’s incredible, it’s part of my daily workflow, and yes — it’s absolutely here to stay. None of that is news. Everyone and their neighbour’s cat has written a post about “How AI Will Change Everything™,” and I refuse to be number 9,045 on that list.</p>
        <p>What does bother me isn’t the technology itself but the very predictable thing humans always do when a shiny new tool shows up: we panic, we overhype, we misuse it, we trust it blindly, and then we act shocked when things go sideways.<br />Congratulations, we have learned nothing since the invention of the calculator.</p>

        <p>People were once terrified of elevators without human operators.<br />People thought calculators would destroy math.<br />People thought the internet would melt our brains. (Okay, jury’s still out on that one.)</p>
        <p>Every technological leap goes through the same cycle: amazement → fear → misuse → normalisation.<br />AI just happens to be the newest kid in class.</p>
        <p>But here’s the twist: AI doesn’t actually threaten the people who understand it. It threatens the people who don’t.</p>

        <h4 class="font-display -mb-4 mt-4 text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-200">If You Don’t Know How Something Works, AI Won’t Save You</h4>

        <p>Everyone is worried AI will “take their jobs.” Honestly? It might — but not because AI is plotting a career in software development.</p>
        <p>It’s because a big chunk of people have no clue how the things they use every day actually work.</p>
        <p>I’ve watched developers who can’t read a 300-line file in the language they supposedly “senior” in. I’ve seen people paste AI-generated code into production without understanding a single line, and then get confused when the whole thing explodes in their face. They come back asking AI to fix the AI. It’s like watching someone drown in ankle-deep water.</p>
        <p>If you can’t explain what your code does line by line, you’re not a senior developer — you’re a tourist with a keyboard.</p>
        <p>AI can generate output, but you are responsible for understanding it. AI can enhance your expertise, but it cannot replace the expertise you never had.</p>

        <h4 class="font-display -mb-4 mt-4 text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-200">The Calculator Problem</h4>

        <p>Back to the calculator analogy.</p>
        <p>A calculator is amazing — if you already know how to do math.</p>
        <p>If you don’t, you’re just pressing buttons and praying to the digital gods that the number popping out is correct.</p>
        <p>AI works exactly the same way.</p>
        <p>You must first understand the fundamentals — how things behave, why they work, what good looks like — before you let a machine “speed it up” for you. Otherwise, AI isn’t helping you. It’s hiding your ignorance behind colourful syntax highlighting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-8">
        <h4 class="font-display -mb-4 mt-4 text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-200">AI Should Make You Better, Not Replace Your Brain</h4>

        <p>Here’s the dirty secret nobody wants to admit:

            AI doesn’t eliminate the need for knowledge — it multiplies the value of the knowledge you already have.

            If you understand your craft deeply, AI makes you a force of nature.
            If you don’t… AI just makes your mistakes faster and louder.

            The people who will thrive in an AI-driven world are the ones who know:
            •	how their tools actually work,
            •	how to question output,
            •	how to debug garbage,
            •	and how to recognise when something “smells wrong.”

            That requires fundamentals. Not vibes.</p>

        <h4 class="font-display -mb-4 mt-4 text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-200">Go Back to Base One</h4>

        <p>If there’s one message I want the next generation of developers — or anyone, really — to hear, it’s this: Learn the basics. Learn them properly. Learn them painfully.</p>
        <p>Understand your tools before you automate them.</p>
        <p>Understand your craft before you scale it.</p>
        <p>Understand the work before you outsource the thinking.</p>
        <p>Then, by all means, use AI to rocket-launch your productivity.</p>
        <p>But don’t get the order wrong. Build the foundation first. Then add the jetpack.</p>
